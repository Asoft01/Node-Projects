# Day 7/11
# 1. I accomplished the saveable and re-accesible of data for entity classification records including questions and answers in json format
# 2. Will be completing the modification of endpoint and adding the integration of Email Template on every creation of account for both single users and bulk users feature 
# 3. Hussain reached out to me on the roles and permission system endpoint which needs some reviewing in respect to project 1 because the PR had been opened for review by one of the senior dev guys (julius). I will be making it my priority for today and once completed, I will be getting back to hussain accordingly. 

# I told him he can focus on other priority tasks.

# For me I just scrolled up to copy some relevant messages and links that might be of use for some upcoming tasks such as "Overview notes regarding our reporting module" prior to archiving. 
# Maybe project 2 team members can as well double check some relevant messages that might be of use for them as well before you archive it.
